# Studio clock

### What is this?

It's a clock. You tell the time with it.

The clock is designed to resemble a [studio clock](https://www.google.com/search?q=studio+clock&&tbm=isch) of the sorts you'd find in a radio or TV broadcasting studio. It has a radial set of pips displaying seconds, useful for running countdowns and keeping to a tight schedule.

### How do I use it?

Just open the [web app](https://deains.github.io/studio-clock) and you're done. The app uses your system time (and time zone), so make sure those are properly synced if accuracy is a concern.

### Can I use this for another project?
